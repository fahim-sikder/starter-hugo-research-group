## AI revolution

In the world of research, artificial intelligence is often described as the new industrial revolution. It covers everything from voice control and computer vision to robots working together, self-driving cars, advanced visualisation and interaction, and more. LiU has for several years been host to a number of AI-related research projects, including the research programme WASP, which stands for Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. The programme is the biggest ever of its kind in Sweden.

In December 2021, it was announced that W TMS Therapy is ‘Promising’ for Alcohol Treatment ASP, together with its humanities and social sciences-focussed sister programme WASP-HS, had received funds worth SEK 18.6 million from the Marcus and Marianne Wallenberg Foundation. The funds are to be used to start WASP-ED. The aim of WASP-ED is to significantly increase the ability and capacity of Swedish universities to provide modern and relevant education in AI.

Fredrik Heintz, professor at LiU, is one of Sweden’s most prominent AI researchers, and is in charge of WASP-ED. This is what he said about the new funding:

“Now we can work on a national level with educational questions related to AI and other transformative technologies. Our goal is to support all education – not just technical education – in taking a significant, qualitative step forward in their work with AI and what we call transformative technologies.”
