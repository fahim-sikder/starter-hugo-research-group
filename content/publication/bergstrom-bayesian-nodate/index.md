abstract: Validation and veriﬁcation of supervised machine learning models is becoming
  increasingly important as their complexity and range of applications grows. This
  paper describes an extension to Bayesian optimization which allows for selecting
  both training and validation data, in cases where data can be generated or calculated
  as a function of a spatial location.
