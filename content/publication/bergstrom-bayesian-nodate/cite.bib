 abstract = {Validation and veriﬁcation of supervised machine learning models is becoming increasingly important as their complexity and range of applications grows. This paper describes an extension to Bayesian optimization which allows for selecting both training and validation data, in cases where data can be generated or calculated as a function of a spatial location.},
