 abstract = {Robot safety is of growing concern given recent developments in intelligent autonomous systems. For complex agents operating in uncertain, complex and rapidly-changing environments it is difficult to guarantee safety without imposing unrealistic assumptions and restrictions. It is therefore necessary to complement traditional formal verification with monitoring of the running system after deployment. Runtime verification can be used to monitor that an agent behaves according to a formal specification. The specification can contain safety-related requirements and assumptions about the environment, environment-agent interactions and agent-agent interactions. A key problem is the uncertain and changing nature of the environment. This necessitates requirements on how probable a certain outcome is and on predictions of future states. We propose Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (ProbSTL) by extending Signal Temporal Logic with a sub-language to allow statements over probabilities, observations and predictions. We further introduce and prove the correctness of the incremental stream reasoning technique progression over well-formed formulas in ProbSTL. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the applicability and benefits of ProbSTL for robot safety.},
