abstract: Robot safety is of growing concern given recent developments in intelligent
  autonomous systems. For complex agents operating in uncertain, complex and rapidly-changing
  environments it is difficult to guarantee safety without imposing unrealistic assumptions
  and restrictions. It is therefore necessary to complement traditional formal verification
  with monitoring of the running system after deployment. Runtime verification can
  be used to monitor that an agent behaves according to a formal specification. The
  specification can contain safety-related requirements and assumptions about the
  environment, environment-agent interactions and agent-agent interactions. A key
  problem is the uncertain and changing nature of the environment. This necessitates
  requirements on how probable a certain outcome is and on predictions of future states.
  We propose Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (ProbSTL) by extending Signal Temporal
  Logic with a sub-language to allow statements over probabilities, observations and
  predictions. We further introduce and prove the correctness of the incremental stream
  reasoning technique progression over well-formed formulas in ProbSTL. Experimental
  evaluations demonstrate the applicability and benefits of ProbSTL for robot safety.
