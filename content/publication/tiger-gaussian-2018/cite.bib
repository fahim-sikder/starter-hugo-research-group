 abstract = {Conventional trajectory-based vehicular trafﬁc analysis approaches work well in simple environments such as a single crossing but they do not scale to more structurally complex environments such as networks of interconnected crossings (e.g. urban road networks). Local trajectory models are necessary to cope with the multi-modality of such structures, which in turn introduces new challenges. These larger and more complex environments increase the occurrences of lack of motion and self-overlaps in observed trajectories which impose further challenges. In this paper we consider the problem of motion pattern recognition in the setting of sequential local motion pattern models. That is, classifying sub-trajectories from observed trajectories in accordance with which motion pattern that best explains it. We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) based modeling approach which outperforms the stateof-the-art GP based motion pattern approaches at this task. We investigate the impact of varying local model overlap and the length of the observed trajectory trace on the classiﬁcation quality. We further show that introducing a pre-processing step ﬁltering out stops from the training data signiﬁcantly improves the classiﬁcation performance. The approach is evaluated using real GPS position data from city buses driving in urban areas.},
