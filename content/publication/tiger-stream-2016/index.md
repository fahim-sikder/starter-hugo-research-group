abstract: Integrating logical and probabilistic reasoning and integrating reasoning
  over observations and predictions are two important challenges in AI. In this paper
  we propose P-MTL as an extension to Metric Temporal Logic supporting temporal logical
  reasoning over probabilistic and predicted states. The contributions are (1) reasoning
  over uncertain states at single time points, (2) reasoning over uncertain states
  between time points, (3) reasoning over uncertain predictions of future and past
  states and (4) a computational environment formalism that ground the uncertainty
  in observations of the physical world. Concrete robot soccer examples are given.
