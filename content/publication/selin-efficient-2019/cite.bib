 abstract = {Exploration is an important aspect of robotics, whether it is for mapping, rescue missions or path planning in an unknown environment. Frontier Exploration planning (FEP) and Receding Horizon Next-Best-View planning (RH-NBVP) are two different approaches with different strengths and weaknesses. FEP explores a large environment consisting of separate regions with ease, but is slow at reaching full exploration due to moving back and forth between regions. RH-NBVP shows great potential and efﬁciently explores individual regions, but has the disadvantage that it can get stuck in large environments not exploring all regions. In this work we present a method that combines both approaches, with FEP as a global exploration planner and RH-NBVP for local exploration. We also present techniques to estimate potential information gain faster, to cache previously estimated gains and to exploit these to efﬁciently estimate new queries.},
