abstract: Learning to recognize common activities such as trafﬁc activities and robot
  behavior is an important and challenging problem related both to AI and robotics.
  We propose an unsupervised approach that takes streams of observations of objects
  as input and learns a probabilistic representation of the observed spatiotemporal
  activities and their causal relations. The dynamics of the activities are modeled
  using sparse Gaussian processes and their causal relations using a probabilistic
  graph. The learned model supports in limited form both estimating the most likely
  current activity and predicting the most likely future activities. The framework
  is evaluated by learning activities in a simulated trafﬁc monitoring application
  and by learning the ﬂight patterns of an autonomous quadcopter.
